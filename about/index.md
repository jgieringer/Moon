I'm Josh [Gieringer](https://forvo.com/word/gieringer/) (two hard Gs)

## Real quick:
* Born & raised in Little Rock, AR.
* I escaped to Nashville, TN in 2010 to become a studio drummer but traded it on day one to earn a B.S. in Computer Science in 2014 from Belmont University.
* I'm fond of NLP and I science data at [Digital Reasoning](https://digitalreasoning.com)
* I enjoy traveling, biking, kicking soccer balls, the Oxford comma, and running trails.

## Speaking of travel:
Traveling for work is fun, but traveling while working is way more fun(ner).
Starting February 14, 2019, I bought [The Van Pearl](https://www.instagram.com/the.van.pearl/) and drove her to New Hampshire to be converted into my future home by Nick Nelsen of [Exploration Van Works](https://www.instagram.com/exploration.van.works/).
